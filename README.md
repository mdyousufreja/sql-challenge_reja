# Background # 

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

## Files ##

Downloaded the following files to get started:

Module 9 Challenge [files](https://courses.bootcampspot.com/courses/3819/assignments/56681?module_item_id=999676)


## Instructions ##

This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.


## Data Modeling ##

Inspected the CSV files, and then sketched an Entity Relationship Diagram (ER) of the tables. Created the sketch using a tool like QuickDBD [links](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/)

## Data Engineering ##

1. Used the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

   - Specified the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

   - For the primary keys, verified that the column is unique. Otherwise, created a composite keyLinks to an external       site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

   - Created the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

2. Imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
